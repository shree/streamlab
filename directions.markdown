# Youtube Stats

## Mission

Create a webapp that allows users to login with their Youtube/Google account and
join a live video stream. Once in the stream, it should stream all chat messages
and update live. Store these messages and create another interface that will
return all chat messages from a given username.

## Time Allotted: 8 Hours

## Bonus

Create a stats pages that tells us the amount of hype in chat (messages/second
or any other algorithm you choose) over a period of time.

## Notes

## Back-end

There dozens of programming languages to choose from so feel free to choose what
you believe suites the task. Also let us know how comfortable you are with the
chosen language so we can take that into consideration as we are reading through
your code.

## Front-end

The front-end should be a single `index.html` file linking to external CSS/JS.
Psst, this is a good chance to flex your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

## Deploying

Feel free to deploying to anywhere you like as we will not be judging you on
your dev-ops skills. Heroku tends to be pretty easy for someone with no dev-ops
experience.
